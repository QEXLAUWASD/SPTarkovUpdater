Created by Delod with help from Sh and AcidPhantasm

Codebase with help from Shibs Expanded Crafting (https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/2545-shibs-expanded-crafting/)

Thank you to them all and for you downloading this mod!

This mod adds 8 new crafting recipes involving the new Arena Lockboxes acquired from opening sealed containers
The Base game does not have these recipes in place yet, but by adding this mod you will be able to unlock the
boxes since they are acquired in SPT.

Enjoy the loot!
